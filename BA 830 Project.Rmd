## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#library
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(lfe)
library(fixest)
library(lubridate)
library(stargazer)
library(modelsummary)
```

```{r}
#import the file
food <- fread('BA830-Project.csv')
```

```{r}
food %>% mutate (outcome_plate = recode (outcome_plate, '0' = 1, '1' = 0))
```
```{r}
#proportion test
prop.test(nrow(food[Treatment ==  1]), nrow(food), 0.5)
```
The p value here is lower than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis which the randomization was not property done, so it may cause some problem with the experiment result. 

```{r}
reg.plate <- lm(outcome_plate ~ Treatment, data = food)
summary(reg.plate)
```

```{r}
reg.question <- lm(outcome_question ~ Treatment, data = food)
summary(reg.question)
```

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
